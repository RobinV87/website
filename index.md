# Party like it's 1999! ðŸ¥³

## Whoami?

You might think that this header is a typo, but I'm **Robin**, an IT Customer Support Engineer who is really into _Cybersecurity_.

Want to know more? Well, let's start at the beginning!

In my free time, I'm a **Game Master** for a couple of groups and rent my services to people who want to play **tabletop games**. Traveling is also a huge part of my life; knowing that I will be in an airplane going on some adventure is what I live for.

Admittedly, most of my adventures take me to **Disney**, which is also a huge obsession that ties with my other obsessions. Let me go on a **Disney Cruise** and you'll have me very happy!

## LS MKDIR

Letâ€™s go a bit deeper now, and do like the commands say, **list out** who I am and make a **directory** of who I am and what I do.

We will have to start at the beginning, way back when a **1.44MB floppy disk** could destroy the world. I was 8 years old and my dad had bought a **MSDOS computer**.

I was pretty good at learning the **commands**, I believe I had this little cheat sheet with how to traverse the **file structure**. I loaded up my favorite games like:

- **Commander Keen**
- **Doom**
- **Duke Nukem**
- **Jazz Jackrabbit**
- And many more!

When we moved on to **Windows 3.1**, it felt like a new world â€” no more stuffy **command line**, which had been such a big part of me growing up. Then came **Windows 95**, the first time I got into contact with **The Internet!**

The **modem** hogged the **telephone line**, and you had to pay per minute to use it. The **56KB Dial-Up Modem** was not reliable at all, and with parents who thought it was all magic and couldn't understand it, **8-year-old** me started fixing our **Dial-Up Modem**.

If there were ever a book written about me, that should be my **origin story** â€” sitting on the telephone with **support agents** who were teaching me everything, even stuff I still use in **my job** right now!

A couple of years later I got some **friends** who were just as into **computers** as I was. We decided to learn how to abuse the horrible **password security** to access certain websites... ðŸ˜… We also started downloading whatever we wanted and even selling games on **floppy disks**. Gotta love flea markets â€” we sold games and bought more PokÃ©mon cards!

The internet got faster. **ADSL** was the next big thing, and my friend even got **satellite internet**. It felt like the future! **Online gaming** became a thing and I played Tony Hawk Pro Skater **online with people**. Thinking back on it, it was horribly choppy and slow â€” but it was possible!

Blink twice, and now we have **gigabit internet** and can play **Dungeons & Dragons** with people **all over the world!**

**And the fun thing is, we are only just starting!**
