    <h2>Whoami?</h2>
    <p>You might think that this header is a typo, but I'm <b>Robin</b>, an IT Customer Support Engineer who is really into <u>Cybersecurity</u>.</p>
    <p>Want to know more? Well let's start at the beginning!</p>
    <p>In my free time, I'm a <b>Game Master</b> for a couple of groups and rent my services to people who want to play <b>tabletop games</b>. Traveling is also a huge part of my life; knowing that I will be in an airplane going on some adventure is what I live for.</p>
    <p>Admittedly, most of my adventures take me to <b>Disney</b>, which is also a huge obsession that ties with my other obsessions. Let me go on a <b>Disney Cruise</b> and you'll have me very happy!</p>

      <p>Let's go a bit deeper now, and do like the commands say, <b>list out</b> who I am and make a <b>directory</b> of who I am and what I do. We will have to start at the beginning,
        way back when a <b>1.44MB floppy disk</b> could destroy the world, I was 8 years old and my dad had bought a <b>MSDOS computer.</b></p>
      <p>I was pretty good in learning the <b>commands</b>, I believe I had this little cheat sheet with hos to traverse the <b>file structure</b> that we had. Loading up my favrotie games like:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Commander Keen</b></li>
        <li><b>Doom</b></li>
        <li><b>Duke Nukem</b></li>
        <li><b>Jazz Jackrabbit</b></li>
        <li>And many more!</li>
      </ul>
    <p>When We soon went on to <b>Windows 3.1</b>, it felt like a new world, no more stuffy <b>command line</b>, that was such a big part of me growing up. And then came <b>Windows 95</b>, the first time I got into contact with <b>The Internet!</b>
    The <b>modem</b> that hogged the <b>telephone line</b> and you had to pay per minute to use it. But the <b>56KB Dial Up Modem</b> was not reliable at all, and with parents who thought it was all magic and couldn't understand it, <b>8 year old</b> me started fixing
    our <b>Dial Up Modem</b>. If there would ever be a book written about me, that should be my <b>origin story</b>, sitting on the telephone with <b>support agents</b> who were teaching me everything, even stuff I still use in <b>my job</b> right now!</p>
    <p>A couple of years later I got some <b>friends</b> who were as much into <b>computers</b> as me and we decided to learn how to abuse the horrible <b>password security</b> to be able to...access certain websites. We also started downloading anything we wanted and even
    selling games on <b>Floppy disks</b>. Gotta love flee markets where anything could be sold and we could buy more Pokemon cards!</p>
    <p>The internet got faster, <b>ADSL</b> was the next big thing, and my friend even got <b>Satelite internet</b>, it felt like we were in the future! <b>Online gaming</b> became a thing and I played Tony Hawk Pro Skater <b>online with people</b>. Thinking back on it,
    It was horribly choppy and slow, but it was possible. You blink two times and you have <b>gigabit internet</b> and you can play Dungeons and Dragons with people <b>all over the world!</b></p>
    <p>And the fun thing is, we are only just starting!</p>
